**PvE Stats** — View lobby difficulty and personal accomplishments from PvE games, shown directly in an in-game RmlUi panel.

It uses the current map, team size, encounter, and effective lobby settings to show a representative-team win chance and where the setup sits among eligible played games.

*Network note: PvE Stats currently uses unencrypted HTTP, so requests and responses are not encrypted in transit.*

# 1. Install

### __PowerShell__

With BAR in its default location, this installs the required widget and responsibility-focused modules:

```pwsh
$widget = "gui_pve_stats"
$folder = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Beyond-All-Reason\data\LuaUI\Widgets\$widget"
$source = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tetrisface/community-widgets/main/$widget"
$files = @("$widget.lua", "$widget.rml", "$widget.rcss",
    "include/request.lua", "include/remote.lua", "include/fetch.lua",
    "include/display.lua", "include/player_stats.lua", "include/histogram.lua",
    "include/diagnostics.lua", "include/view_model.lua")

New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$folder\include" | Out-Null

foreach ($file in $files) {
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "$source/$file" -OutFile "$folder/$file"
}
```

### __Manual__

1. Open `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Beyond-All-Reason\data\LuaUI\Widgets`.
2. Download the repository ZIP from <https://github.com/tetrisface/community-widgets/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>.
3. Open the ZIP and then the `community-widgets-main` folder.
4. Drag the `gui_pve_stats` folder into `Widgets`.
5. Verify this folder structure:

```text
LuaUI/
└─ Widgets/
   └─ gui_pve_stats/
      ├─ gui_pve_stats.lua
      ├─ gui_pve_stats.rml
      ├─ gui_pve_stats.rcss
      └─ include/
         ├─ request.lua
         ├─ remote.lua
         ├─ ...
```

# 2. Enable

Restart BAR or run `/luaui reload`, then enable **PvE Stats** in the widget list (F11).

# **Core features**

- **Win Chance** for a representative current BAR human team playing the current setup
- **Challenge** score, **Difficulty Percentile**, and a histogram showing the setup's difficulty among eligible played games
- Exact or similar **setting comparison**, with detailed lobby-setting differences available under **Diag**
- Sortable player views for **Awards**, **Encounters**, **Games & Maps**, **Milestones**, and **Lobby Settings**
